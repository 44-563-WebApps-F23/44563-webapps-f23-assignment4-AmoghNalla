        <p><b>MANDERS.</b></p> 
        <p>Why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! A fallen man!</p>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b></p>
        <p>Do you think Alving was any purer when I went with him to
        the altar than Johanna was when Engstrand married her?</p>

       <p><b>MANDERS</b>.<br>
         Well, but there is a world of difference between the two
        cases--</p>

        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b> <br>
        Not so much difference after all--except in the price:--a
        miserable three hundred dollars and a whole fortune.</p>

        <p><b>MANDERS.</b> <br>
        How can you compare such absolutely dissimilar cases? You had
        taken counsel with your own heart and with your natural advisers.</p>

       <p> <b>MRS. ALVING.</b> 
        <p style="color: red;">[Without looking at him.]</p> I thought you understood where
        what you call my heart had strayed to at the time.</p>

        <p><b>MANDERS.</b>
        <p style="color:red;">[Distantly.]</p> Had I understood anything of the kind, I should
        not have been a daily guest in your husband's house.</p>
