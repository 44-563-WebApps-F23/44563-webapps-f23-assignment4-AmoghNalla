        <h1>Amogh acts in a play</h1>
        <h3>Name of the play : Ghosts Act 2</h3>
        <h3>Name of the author: Henrik Ibsen</h3>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">Why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! A fallen man!</p>

        <h3 class ="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class ="code">Do you think Alving was any purer when I went with him to
        the altar than Johanna was when Engstrand married her?</p>

        <h3 class ="madners">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">Well, but there is a world of difference between the two
        cases--</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class="code">Not so much difference after all--except in the price:--a
        miserable three hundred dollars and a whole fortune.</p>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">How can you compare such absolutely dissimilar cases? You had
        taken counsel with your own heart and with your natural advisers.</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class="code2">[Without looking at him.]</p><p class="code">I thought you understood where
        what you call my heart had strayed to at the time.</p>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code2">[Distantly.]</p><p class ="code">Had I understood anything of the kind, I should
        not have been a daily guest in your husband's house.</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class ="code">At any rate, the fact remains that with myself I took no
        counsel whatever.</p>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">Well then, with your nearest relatives--as your duty bade
        you--with your mother and your two aunts.</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class ="code">Yes, that is true. Those three cast up the account for me.
        Oh, it's marvellous how clearly they made out that it would be downright
        madness to refuse such an offer. If mother could only see me now, and
        know what all that grandeur has come to!</p>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">Nobody can be held responsible for the result. This, at least,
        remains clear: your marriage was in full accordance with law and order.</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class ="code2">[At the window.]</p><p class ="code">Oh, that perpetual law and order! I often
        think that is what does all the mischief in this world of ours.</p>

        <h3 class="manders">MANDERS.</h3><p class ="code">Mrs. Alving, that is a sinful way of talking.</p>

        <h3 class="mrsalving">MRS. ALVING.</h3><p class ="code">Well, I can't help it; I must have done with all this
        constraint and insincerity. I can endure it no longer. I must work my
l        way out to freedom.</p>
